I will take the data from Machine Learning Summer Training Hackathon.
Steps:
1. Univariate analisys of features. Check for normal distribution and outliers
2. Bivariate analisys of features. Check for correlation between features and target variables
3. Check for Correlation matrix
4. Feature Imputing for 'education'
5. One hot encoding for 'proof_submitted'
6. Label Encoding for 'education'
7. Modelling.
My model is Random Forest Classifier Final macro f1_score=0.524564 for test pd.
